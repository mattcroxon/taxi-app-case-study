Architecture Pattern: Cross-App Integration via Deep Linking & API Orchestration

  Core Integration Strategy

  1. App-to-App Communication - Deep linking between Priority Pass and Uber apps
  2. Backend Service Integration - Priority Pass backend integrates with Uber API v1.2
  3. Flight Context Intelligence - Enhanced ride timing based on flight data
  4. Unified Booking Flow - Seamless handoff between apps with context preservation

  Key Components

  Priority Pass App Enhancements:
  - Flight Context Service - Processes flight data to calculate optimal departure times
  - Uber Integration Service - Handles Uber API calls and ride orchestration
  - Deep Link Handler - Manages handoffs to/from Uber app with context

  Integration Layer:
  - Ride Orchestration API - Manages ride booking lifecycle
  - Context Preservation Service - Maintains user state across app transitions
  - Notification Hub - Real-time updates across both platforms

  API Integration Flow

  1. Ride Request Preparation:
  GET /products → Select appropriate Uber product
  POST /requests/estimate → Get upfront fare with flight context
  2. Smart Booking Flow:
  Priority Pass calculates: Flight arrival - 45min = Uber pickup time
  POST /v1.2/requests → Create ride with scheduled pickup
  Deep link to Uber app → User completes in native Uber experience
  3. Cross-App State Management:
    - Priority Pass maintains booking reference
    - Uber app handles ride execution
    - Status updates flow back via webhooks/polling

  Enhanced User Experience

  - Smart Timing: "Book Uber for 2:30 PM (45 min before your 3:15 PM flight)"
  - Seamless Handoff: Deep link preserves pickup location and destination
  - Unified History: Ride details appear in Priority Pass trip summary

  This approach leverages native app strengths while providing intelligent flight-based recommendations.
