## Objective 

Design a scalable, maintainable, and well-structured system that integrates the **redacted** app with a global taxi app to
enhance the airport journey for travelers. The system should:
- Provide a simple, intuitive interface for users to manage their airport transportation, within the Priority Pass app and the Taxi app
- Display estimated arrival times and recommended departure times based on flight details
- Enable inventory sharing between the two platforms (e.g., taxi app can surface **redacted** content, and vice versa)

You’ll create a C4 diagram describing it and prototype the front-end interface for this experience.

## Time expectation
2–3 hours: You’re not expected to build a full-featured system. Focus on strong architectural foundations, thoughtful design
decisions, and clear communication.

## What we're evaluating 
**Architecture & Design**: Use of the C4 model to communicate system structure and responsibilities.
Technical Thinking: How you
break down the pro
blem and design scalable, extensible components.

**Client Focus**: How clearly and effectively you communicate your ideas, assumptions, and trade-offs especially in a way that would make sense to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Use of AI Tools**: How you used tools like ChatGPT or Copilot to assist you, and your judgment in applying the output.

## Expected deliverables 
1. C4 Digrams 
- Context Diagram: Show the system’s users and external systems.
- Container Diagram: Break the system into major services .
- Component Diagram: Choose one container and break it into internal components.

2. Front end prototype 
- Design a basic UI for the integrated experience, this can be done in any tool of your choosing (e.g. Figma, React, Balsamiq) to effectively communicate the envisioned architecture, user flow and customer value proposition.
- We will ask you to present this to us as if you are presenting it to a client.

3. ReadMe 
Include the following:
- Architecture Overview: Your technical choices and rationale
- Omissions & Trade-offs:
- Features or polish you skipped and why
- Any shortcuts taken and how you’d address them

**Tips for Success**
- Think in Layers: Focus on clean separation between data, logic, and UI.
- Be Realistic: Prioritize what matters most in a real-world MVP.
